When the Create button is clicked, the content of the form that passes the validation creates a
record in the table below the form.
There should be Edit and Delete buttons on the same line for each record.
Clicking the edit button will display a popup for the relevant record.
In a form displayed in the popup, the Priority selection box should appear with the current Priority
information selected.When the "Update" button in the popup is clicked, the Priority value will
update the related record.(Job value cannot be changed, only Priority value can be changed)
Clicking the Delete button in the table will delete the related record.
There must be a Job search input above the table. Whenever this input content changes, the lines
containing the related Job record should be filtered and displayed in the table.
The records in the table should be displayed in descending order according to the order of
priority.
The background color for each record in the table should be the color representing the priority of
the relevant record.
